# Assignment Task
How to create your assignment

The provided code base already allows you to store and access both user and item data remotely
 using Elasticsearch. In this assignment, you will modify the code to implement remote data storage and access for bids.

To accomplish this, you will find it useful to study how Elasticsearch has been implemented 
for items and users.

#### Specifically, you will need to implement the following methods in the ElasticSearchManager class:

* RemoveBidTask() - Delete bid from remote server using bid_id
* AddBidTask() - Add bid to remote server
* GetBidListTask() - Returns all remote bids from server

#### Modify the command classes:

* AddBidCommand
* DeleteBidCommand

#### Modify the BidList class:

* Add getRemoteBids()
* Remove loadBids()

#### Modify the following methods in the BidListController class
* addBid()
* removeBid()
* removeItemBids()
* Add getRemoteBids()
* Remove loadBids()

#### Finally, you will modify the following views and adapter:

* ViewItemActivity
* ViewItemBidsActivity
* ItemFragmentAdapter

## Submission Instructions

When you are ready to submit your code, include the following files in a folder:

* ElasticSearchManager.java
* AddBidCommand.java
* DeleteBidCommand.java
* BidList.java
* BidListController.java
* ViewItemActivity.java
* ViewItemBidsActivity.java
* ItemFragmentAdapter.java
